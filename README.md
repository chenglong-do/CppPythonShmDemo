# CppPythonShmDemo

**A Cross-Language Shared Memory IPC Demo for C++ and Python** 

This project demonstrates efficient data communication between C++ and Python using shared memory, providing a lightweight and high-performance solution for real-time inter-process communication (IPC).

## Use Cases

1. Real-time sensor data streaming (e.g., cameras, LiDAR)
2. Integrating C++ performance-critical modules with Python ML/scripting layers.
